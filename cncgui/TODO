Stuff to do:

   ** Abort on brownout reset!
   ** Figure out why sometimes the mill location is out of sync
   ** Add firmware Version command and use it to display version in GUI

   ** Report exactly which limit switch tripped!!
   ** Log to a text area with access from Gui
   ** Direct command entry to firmware
   * Allow load as trace or load as Mill for a gerber file
   * Create MilledPolygon to approximate milling of a larger cutout (hole) w/geometry
      * Use an interior buffer to calculate, and optionally rasterize interior
      * Edit process to convert DrilledHole to MilledPolygon
   * Allow processing of milled in depth steps (5 steps at a time for example) - Odd Number of passes!
   * Associate isolation mills with traces
   * Save feature (to XML file??)
   * Track tools changes for isolation traces.
   * Allow rasterizing of a polygon with smaller tools
   * Tool Pallete (milling tools available for selection) - add tool dialog
   * Z-Axis speed for drill file.
   * Isolate traces should prompt for tool and depth
   * Link job properties to actions (with tool)
   * Complete Edit - Move option (offset or use mouse)
   * Complete Edit - Properties
   * Use completion flags for run-restart (clear completions), or run - Continue (bypass completed)
   * Split actions to a seperate thread and show progress bar.

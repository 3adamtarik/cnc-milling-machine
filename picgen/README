This directory contains the source and generated HEX files for the 
PICGen Function Generator and Frequency Counter originally printed in
the July 2000 issue of Everyday Practical Electronics magazine (EPE).

This version of the code was converted in syntax from the TASM assembler 
to the Microchip provided assembler, and the code has slight modifications
to work with a 2 line display.

For more project details, see the original EPE article, and my blog at:
